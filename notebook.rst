 The IPython Notebook
======================

The IPython Notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which
you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media, and store the results in a persistent way. It aims to be an agile tool both for exploratory computation and data analysis, as well as reproducible research.

The IPython Notebook combines together several pieces:

* The IPython Notebook web application
	The dynamic IPython Notebook is a web application which runs in a web browser.


* IPython notebook documents, which provide a persistent record of the calculations and results



 Notebook documents, or notebooks,	 are standard text files that can be stored in version control systems and 
 shared with colleagues. The results that they contain can be easily output to other static formats, such as HTML, PDF, and slide shows.

You may share any publicly
available notebook by using the `IPython Notebook Viewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org>`_ service, which will render it as a static web
page. This makes it easy to give your colleagues a document they can read
immediately without having to install anything.

To learn more about using the IPython Notebook, you can visit our `example
collection`_, and you can read the documentation_ for all the details on how to
use and configure the system. The `Notebook Gallery`_ showcases many
interesting notebooks covering a variety of topics, from basic programming to
advanced scientific computing.


Here is a short demo of the notebook's basic features by the Pybonacci_ team:
